Subject: [PATCH] Patch setup.cfg to move cryptographic dependencies to
 run_constrained

- Remove ecdsa, rsa and pyasn1 from install_requires
- Add comment explaining cryptography is the recommended backend and when
  cryptography is installed, rsa, ecdsa and pyasn1 are unused

This change allows users to install only the cryptographic backends they need
while maintaining compatibility constraints for optional dependencies.
